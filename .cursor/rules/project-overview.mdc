# READ.VIDEO Landing Page Project

This is a Next.js 15 project that creates an interactive space-themed landing page with:
- Three.js space scene with randomly generated stars, planets, and rings
- Countdown animation (READ.VIDE[3,2,1,O])
- Typing text effect with email functionality
- Interactive camera controls (mouse/touch drag + zoom)
- Random camera movement through space
