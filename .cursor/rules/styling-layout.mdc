# Styling and Layout Rules

## CSS Approach
- Use custom CSS, NOT Tailwind CSS
- Ensure black background (`background-color: black`)
- Implement proper z-index layering for overlays
- Use absolute positioning for centered elements
- Maintain responsive design for all screen sizes

## Animation and Timing
- Countdown: 3→2→1→O over 3 seconds
- Space scene fade-in: 2 seconds after countdown
- Typing effect: 100ms base speed with delays for special characters
- Random messages: 2s delay after email copy, 4s total cycle

## Visual Elements
- Maintain black space theme throughout
- Ensure proper contrast for text elements
- Use consistent spacing and positioning
- Implement smooth transitions and animations
- Keep UI elements minimal and unobtrusive
